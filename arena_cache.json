Try to keep images under 400 KB\n\n### 2. Fill in the **Title** field as the post's slug generation relies on this\n\n### 3. Refer to [are.na's guide to markdown](https://help.are.na/docs/getting-started/blocks/adding-blocks#formatting-text) for text formatting\n\n### 4. Optional Styling and Metadata –\n\nYou can personalise the appearance and metadata of your post by including any of the following special keys in the **Description** field. Each key should be followed by the relevant value on the same line.\n\n- Tags: Add relevant keywords to help categorise and improve the discoverability of your post.\nExample: \"Tags: permacomputing, DIY, low-tech\"\n\n- Colour: Define a background colour for your post using a hex code.\nExample: \"Colour: #F0F8FF\"\n\n- Border: Define a border colour for your post using a hex code.\nExample: \"Border: #CCCCCC\"\n\n- Author: Add your name or pseudonym to be displayed as the post’s author.\nExample: \"Author: Alex\"\n\n- Pin: Use \"Pin: top\" if you want your post to stay pinned at the top of the feed.\nExample: \"Pin: top\"\n\nNotes:\n\n- The description keys are not case-sensitive, but they must be written with the colon, and each should appear on its own line within the description. \n\n- The website polls for are.na data every 10 minutes, so when you add or delete a block, it might take some time for the frontend to update.\n\n- Take a look at the source code on GitHub and go through its readme to understand how this is used as our CMS! :)"
